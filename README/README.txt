************************* TCP CLIENT AND SERVER *************************

INTRODUCTION :

This is a College project where I have to create two separate programs. A C++ Chat Client that communicates through TCP
and a C++ Chat Server that communicates through TCP into my project and initialize it using C++. It uses Big Endian serializing
and Deserializing for 32bit Unsigned int and 16bit Unsigned Short and String

BUILDING AND RUNNING :

* Extract the .zip file amd you can find the project folder with this readme folder
* Go inside the project folder and you can find a folder named x64.
* Open x64 folder and you can find a folder name Debug.
* Open the Debug folder and you can find the executable file for the client named Client.
* In the same folder and you can find the executable file for the server named Second Server.
* Open the server to Initialise the server, and you can open as many clients as you need to connect to the server and chat

HOW TO USE THE SERVER AND CLIENT :

* Open the Server executable to initialise the server.
* Open as many client as you want to make them connect to the server.
* Once you opened the required amount of client you can simply enter your name and start chatting with other clients.

VISUAL ELEMENTS FOR THE USER WHEN YOU START THE SERVER AND CLIENT :

* When you start the server, the server responds as server is created and chat room initiated.
* When you start the client, the client responds as you are added to the chat room and please enter you name.
* When other clients sends msg the server recieves the message and transmits to other clients except the sender.
